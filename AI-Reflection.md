# **Using AI in Development**

## **How Do You Use AI in Learning and Development?**

I use AI for quick problem-solving, explaining concepts, generating code, and debugging. AI also assists with styling, creating project structure, and designing architecture, as well as helping with structuring projects and brainstorming ideas.

## **Which Tools or Models (ChatGPT, Copilot, Perplexity, etc.) Have You Tried?**

I mainly use ChatGPT and Grok. I used GitHub Copilot when it was free, and I tried using Cursor IDE.

## **What Actually Helps You Grow, and What Hinders?**

Helps: quick answers, code examples, and explanations of complex topics. Hinders: over-reliance on AI, which can reduce independent thinking, and occasional inaccurate responses that require verification.

## **How Would You Integrate AI into a Frontend Developer’s Workflow?**

I’d integrate AI as an IDE assistant (e.g., Copilot), for test automation (generating test cases), code optimization (refactoring, performance analysis), and creating UI mockups (generating CSS or components). I’d also use it for documentation and onboarding new developers.
